What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window? 
     Increasing the size of the training dataset brought the actual and strategy returns closer together, indicationg to me this algorithm is particularly good at predicting performance over the long term. Decreasing the size of the dataset widened the gap between the actual and strategy returns.

 What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows? 
     In the short term changing the SMA numbers significantly affected the difference between the actual and strategy returns and increased the volatility. In the long term, there was an increase in the gap between the actual and strategy numbers, decreasing the confidence in the this model for the algorithm and it's predictive ability.

     In comparing the two sets of data shows once again, the more data over time, the better the predictive ability of a model. 
     The goal of any model is to as closely as possible predict the outcome to insure revenue goes up and losses are kept to the barest minimum possible. The data that that shows the closest correlation between the actual and the strategy returns is when the Data Offset is increased. The more data over time, the better the ability to more accurately predict the returns.
